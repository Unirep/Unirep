** Attester ideas for you **

UniRep balances the anonymity and reputation of user data. You can build an application that enables everyone freedom of speech & expression for things like:
- P2P marketplace with a reputation
- Online resource for Journalist
- The activist group that desired to communicate anonymously
- Upwork alike
- Business review
- Product review

For developers' and public's convenience, we also have explorer that allows you to monitor the attestation activity, you can easily browse the epoch-changing time, epoch key, and many more.
