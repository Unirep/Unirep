# üöÄ Getting Started with `create-unirep-app`

We have developed the [create-unirep-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-unirep-app) package which provides developers with a convenient and efficient way to build their own applications that leverage the power of UniRep.


## üíª Run the application locally
### Installation

1. 
Run
```shell
npx create-unirep-app
```
or 

2. Clone the [Unirep/create-unirep-app](https://github.com/unirep/create-unirep-app) repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/unirep/create-unirep-app && \
cd create-unirep-app && \
yarn
```

### Build the files

Go to the app directory and run

```shell
yarn build
```

### Start a blockchain environment with hardhat

```shell
yarn contracts hardhat node
```

:::info
See [hardhat tutorial](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start)
:::

### Deploy smart contracts

The app builder will deploy the `UnirepApp.sol` as an **[attester](../protocol/users-and-attesters.md#attesters-ü§ñ)** to interact directly with `Unirep.sol`.

In new terminal window, deploy smart contracts with the following command from root:

```shell
yarn contracts deploy
```

Both `Unirep.sol` and `UnirepApp.sol` will be deployed in the hardhat environment.<br/>
:::info
If `Unirep.sol` has been deployed in the testnet, specify the address of the `Unirep.sol` in the `UnirepApp` constructor
```solidity
constructor(
   Unirep _unirep,
   ...
)
```
:::
And the configurations will be written to `create-unirep-app/config.ts`

### Start a relayer (backend)

The app builder can host a relayer to handle request from frontend and relay transactions.<br/>
Also it can provide proving keys for frontend prover.

:::info
Relayer is optional for a unirep application. <br/>
But if users send transactions to `UnirepApp.sol` directly, the users' privacy could be compromised.
:::

Start a relayer with the following command from root:

```shell
yarn relay start
```

When it shows up `Listening on port 8000`, you can run a frontend in a new terminal window.

### Start a frontend server

The frontend is the **[user](../protocol/users-and-attesters.md#users-üë§)**s' interfact to interact with the attester (`UnirepApp.sol`).

In new terminal window, start a frontend server with the following command from root:

```shell
yarn frontend start
```

The frontend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` by default.

## üïπÔ∏è Open frontend to interact with the application

### User Sign up

Click on the **Join** button.

![Join](https://i.imgur.com/vcR3x9D.png)

Then the client will generate a [semaphore identity](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) and a [signup proof](../circuits-api/circuits.md#signup-proof). <br/>
The relayer will submit the signup proof to `UnirepApp.sol` and the user will keep the semaphore identity secretly in the browser.
After the transaction successfully submitted, the window will show a **Dashboard** button.

### Information

<a href="https://imgur.com/8922mih"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8922mih.png" title="Information" width="300"/></a>

#### Epoch

The [epoch](../protocol/epoch.md) information will be shown on the **Epoch** section.

#### Latest Data

It shows the latest [data](../protocol/data.md) of the user, including the requested data and [provable data](#provable-data). <br/>
It will be changed after each data requesting.

#### Provable Data

After [user state transition](../protocol/user-state-transition.md), the user can prove the data he owns. <br/>
It cannot be changed until next user state transition.

### Request Data

<a href="https://imgur.com/qUDm4nB"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qUDm4nB.png" title="Request data" width="400"/></a>

#### Change Data

In the example application, the user can request how much [data](../protocol/data.md) he wants to receive. <br/>
There are two types of data field: *sum field* and *replacement field*. <br/>
The data in *sum field* can only be added together by a new data. <br/>
The data in *replace field* will be only replaced by a new data. <br/>

Also, the user can choose which anonymous identifier ([epoch key](../protocol/epoch-key.md)) with an *epoch key nonce*. <br/>
With different epoch key nonce, the user will generate totally different identifiers. <br/>
e.g.
```shell
# epoch key nonce = 0
Requesting data with epoch key:
0x2b4b15e0173f69807318198d5c1db6c00c44380af2e05912608950e10ba04b43
# epoch key nonce = 1
Requesting data with epoch key:
0x15e1358a646a10aa99756a250d9463b6026fbd09c5f4d28e477085f21eecd197
```

Each epoch key can receive data and they contribute to the same user.

e.g. <br/>
`data[0] = 1` is requested by epoch key: `0x2b4b15e0173f69807318198d5c1db6c00c44380af2e05912608950e10ba04b43`<br/>
`data[0] = 2` is requested by epoch key: `0x15e1358a646a10aa99756a250d9463b6026fbd09c5f4d28e477085f21eecd197`

the final `data[0]` of the user is `3` since 1 + 2 = 3

:::caution
These epoch keys only last for one epoch. If epoch updates, new epoch keys will be generated and old epoch keys become invalid.
:::

#### Attest

After the user clicks the **attest** button, an attestation will happen. It executes
1. User generates an epoch key proof to prove the epoch key is valid.
2. User submits the epoch key proof and the requested data to the relayer.
3. Relayer use `UnirepApp.sol` to call [attest](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attest) in `Unirep.sol` 

### User State Transtion

<a href="https://imgur.com/Gly6cti"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gly6cti.png" title="User state transition" width="300"/></a>

If `Current epoch #` does not equal to `Latest transition epoch`, a [user state transition](../protocol/user-state-transition.md) should be performed to receive more data. 
The user state transition should be done manually by users. <br/>
It executes
1. Generate a [user state transition proof](../circuits-api/circuits.md#user-state-transition-proof)
2. Submit the proof to the relayer
3. Relayer updates the `Unirep.sol` contract

Then the [provable data](#provable-data) will be updated because the latest user status is recorded on-chain.<br/>
The user can use the provable data to generate a [data proof](#prove-data).

### Prove Data

<a href="https://imgur.com/6hDmLSs"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6hDmLSs.png" title="Prova data" width="200" /></a>

It proves that each claim data field is more than the provable data field.

:::info
See the customized [data proof circuit](https://github.com/Unirep/create-unirep-app/blob/2ca9aaa3fcacb9282993b8f5d5917afc482ec089/packages/circuits/circuits/dataProof.circom)<br/>
The app builders can customize their own ZK circuits and deploy verifiers to fit the application.
:::

e.g.

If user's provable data is
```shell
Provable Data 0 = 2
Provable Data 1 = 3
Provable Data 2 = 4
Provable Data 3 = 5
```
and user can claim he has data
```shell
Claim Data 0 = 2
Claim Data 1 = 2
Claim Data 2 = 2
Claim Data 3 = 2
```

since
```shell
2 (Provable Data 0) >= 2 (Claim Data 0) # satisfied
3 (Provable Data 1) >= 2 (Claim Data 1) # satisfied
4 (Provable Data 2) >= 2 (Claim Data 2) # satisfied
5 (Provable Data 3) >= 2 (Claim Data 3) # satisfied
```

If the proof is valid, it shows the proof and "Is proof valid? **true**". <br/>
If the proof is invalid, the snarkjs prover throws an error.

e.g.

If user's provable data is
```shell
Provable Data 0 = 2
Provable Data 1 = 3
Provable Data 2 = 4
Provable Data 3 = 5
```
and user claims he has data
```shell
Claim Data 0 = 3
Claim Data 1 = 3
Claim Data 2 = 3
Claim Data 3 = 3
```

It throws an error since

```shell
2 (Provable Data 0) >= 3 (Claim Data 0) # not satisfied
```

## üí° Build your own application

Start with modifying the [`UnirepApp.sol`](https://github.com/Unirep/create-unirep-app/blob/2ca9aaa3fcacb9282993b8f5d5917afc482ec089/packages/contracts/contracts/UnirepApp.sol).

:::info
See all [`Unirep.sol` APIs](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md)
:::

### Change epoch length

Each attester has its own [epoch](../protocol/epoch.md) length. <br/>
Too long: users will use the same epoch keys for a long time and new data cannot be proved immediately. <br/>
Too short: epoch keys last for a short period, it does not have enough time receive much data.

```sol
unit48 epochLength = 60 * 15; // 15 minutes
unirep.attesterSignUp(epochLength);
```

:::info
See [attesterSignUp](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attestersignup)
:::

### Change attestation policy

If users can request as much data as they want, the data will not be valuable in this app. üôÅ <br/>
Try to give each epoch key only `1` data 0 value in each epoch.

```sol
mapping(uint => bool) epochKeyReceivedValue;

function submitAttestation(
   uint epochKey
) public {
   // check if the epoch key receives data or not
   require(epochKeyReceivedValue[epochKey] == false);
   // compute attester ID: the address of the smart contract
   uint160 attesterId = uint160(address(this));
   // get current epoch from unirep
   uint48 targetEpoch = unirep.attesterCurrentEpoch(attesterId);
   // fix field index
   uint fieldIndex = 0;
   // fix data value
   uint val = 1;
   // call unirep attest function
   unirep.attest(
      epochKey,
      targetEpochs,
      fieldIndex,
      val
   );
   // mark the epoch key has received data
   epochKeyReceivedValue[epochKey] = true;
}
```

:::info
See [`attesterCurrentEpoch`](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attestercurrentepoch), [`attest`](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attest)
:::

### Verify epoch key on-chain

Wait. What if user requests with an invalid epoch key? üò® <br/>
Don't worry. The attester contract can force users provide valid epoch keys with [epoch key proof](../circuits-api/circuits.md#epoch-key-proof).<br/>

For example, we can change the function inputs with epoch key proof.

```sol
function submitAttestation(
   uint[] memory publicSignals,
   uint[8] memory proof
) public {
   // verify epoch key proof
   unirep.verifyEpochKeyProof(publicSignals, proof);
}
```

:::info
See [`verifyEpochKeyProof`](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#verifyepochkeyproof)
:::

But how can we tell which signal is epoch key?<br/>
`Unirep.sol` also provides [`decodeEpochKeySignals`](../contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#decodeepochkeysignals) to fix this problem.

We can complete the `submitAttestation` function with `decodeEpochKeySignals`.

```sol
mapping(uint => bool) epochKeyReceivedValue;

function submitAttestation(
   uint[] memory publicSignals,
   uint[8] memory proof
) public {
   // verify epoch key proof
   unirep.verifyEpochKeyProof(publicSignals, proof);
   // deocode epoch key signals
   Unirep.EpochKeySignals memory signals = unirep.decodeEpochKeySignals(publicSignals);
   // check if the epoch key receives data or not
   require(epochKeyReceivedValue[signals.epochKey] == false);
   // compute attester ID: the address of the smart contract
   uint160 attesterId = uint160(address(this));
   // get current epoch from unirep
   uint48 targetEpoch = unirep.attesterCurrentEpoch(attesterId);
   // fix field index
   uint fieldIndex = 0;
   // fix data value
   uint val = 1;
   // call unirep attest function
   unirep.attest(
      signals.epochKey,
      targetEpoch,
      fieldIndex,
      val
   );
   // mark the epoch key has received data
   epochKeyReceivedValue[signals.epochKey] = true;
}
```

Now, start building your own application with UniRep. üöÄ
