# üèóÔ∏è What Can I Build With UniRep

## UniRep is a generalized protocol that allow developers to build many different kinds of applications while keeping users anonymous. Here are a few examples to illustrate the broad range of applications that could be built:

**Peer-to-Peer Anonymous Lending:**
 - A problem in current decentralized protocols is that most of them rely on the credit system being over-collateralized. With UniRep, the reputation value will be the credit-score of a prospective borrower that will change based on if they follow the credit rules of the prospective system.

**Eth or Token Attesters:**
- It is possible to create an attester where the reputation value is Eth or some Token. This would allow the transfer of value anonymously. 

**Reddit built with UniRep:**
- The most important reputation value in Reddit is the 'karma' users earn. If we built Reddit with UniRep, users could accumulate 'karma' while participating across various forums with unique anonymous identifiers, without associating those activities to their persistent 'account'. Additional features could be built into the platform, where users would prove their ownership of X 'karma' to unlock access to some status Y or some action YA proof of concept built by the UniRep team that aims to do this is [UniRep Social](https://about.unirep.social/goodbye/).

**Anonymous GitHub:**
- Some developers may desire the ability to publish code anonymously. In A GitHub-type application built with UniRep, the data values could be assigned to represent the number of commits a developer has made to a repository, the number of stars they have on their profile, or if they have made successful PRs to a project. These reputation metrics can then be evaluated to grant the anonymous developer access to push to the main branch of a particular repository.



**Journalist Applicaitons:**
- Some countries have restrictive laws governing speech. If a journalist makes a statement or reveals information that is in conflict with their government's messaging, there may be serious repercussions for that individual. With a UniRep application built to support freedom of the press, a journalist could prove that they are associated with a reputable news organization without revealing their identity, and display a badge from that organization when they publish their work. This would enable readers to trust the source of the reporting, and prevent governments or other power-wielding entities from discovering it.

### Multi-Attester Applications:
**Social Applications:**
- It is possible to build attesters that interact with each other. For instance, a social media application can have multiple different groups. Let's say group X has their own reputation value called "Doge" and group Y has their reputation value called "Elon". The rules of how to earn these reputation values are defined by the attester. Multi-attester applications can interact with each other in various ways, too. If a member from group Y earns 50 "Elon" then they could be granted access to another attester that must have at least 50 "Doge" to join. The rules become limitless at this point, but bear in mind all the ideas possible with UniRep; social media is only one example.

**Medical Records:**
- A problem in the Electronic Health Records industry is the lack of interoperability between different healthcare providers. If you go to Hospital X because you live in California, they will store your records in their system. If you go to Hospital Y in New York because you get seriously injured, they will have no idea about your medical background because of poor (or no) systems for sharing records. Even the sharing of records between providers in the same city can come with long delays and major hassles for patients. With UniRep, a user's medical records could be attested to them by each provider at the time of service. When a provider required access to a record, the user would prove with zk that the requested data is theirs. The user would always be in control of their own records, and any stored medical data would be anonymous. In this case each provider would be an attester in an interoperable multi-attester system. Please note: this is only an example, and in dealing with sensitive data such as medical histories, we must keep in mind that new cryptography (like zero-knowledge proofs) may be broken in 50 years.
