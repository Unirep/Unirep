[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a protocol for indexing networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Site owners publish subgraphs that expose site data for anyone to query. UniRep's subgraph allows you to retrieve data from the <a href={`https://github.com/Unirep/Unirep/blob/v${contractVersion}/packages/contracts/contracts/Unirep.sol`}>`Unirep.sol`</a> smart contract.

:::info
The Graph protocol uses the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) query language. For examples, see the [GraphQL API documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/).

## Deployment

<p>
    UniRep subgraph version {contractVersion} is deployed on the following
    networks:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Network</th>
        <th>API</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Goerli</td>
        <td>
            <a href={`${NetworkURL.Goerli}`}>{NetworkURL.Goerli}</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sepolia</td>
        <td>
            <a href={`${NetworkURL.Sepolia}`}>{NetworkURL.Sepolia}</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Arbitrum Goerli</td>
        <td>

## Query Examples

1. Query the first 100 attesters (by default, sorted by `id`).

:::info
`id` is computed by

```ts
event.transaction.hash.concatI32(event.logIndex.toI32())
```

:::

```graphql
query MyQuery {
    attesters {
        attesterId
        blockNumber
        epochLength
        startTimestamp
        transactionHash
    }
}
```

2. Query the first 100 users from a certain attester ID (by default, sorted by `id`).

```graphql
query MyQuery {
    users(
        where: {
            attesterId: "812064237485286466066480536294992408637941768146"
        }
    ) {
        commitment
    }
}
```

3. Query the first 100 state tree leaves, sorted by `index`.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
    stateTreeLeaves(
        orderBy: index
        where: {
            attesterId: "812064237485286466066480536294992408637941768146"
            epoch: "1"
        }
    ) {
        leaf
    }
}
```

3. Query the first 1000 state tree leaves, sorted by `index`.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
    stateTreeLeaves(
        first: 1000
        orderBy: index
        where: {
            attesterId: "812064237485286466066480536294992408637941768146"
            epoch: "1"
        }
    ) {
        leaf
    }
}
```

4. Query the next 1000 state tree leaves, sorted by `index`.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
    stateTreeLeaves(
        skip: 1000
        first: 1000
        orderBy: index
        where: {
            attesterId: "812064237485286466066480536294992408637941768146"
            epoch: "1"
        }
    ) {
        leaf
    }
}
```
