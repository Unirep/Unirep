## Overview

**UniRep** (**Uni**versal **Rep**utation) is a _private_ and _non-repudiable_ **reputation system**. Applications can associate user data with anonymous entities (users). Users can:&#x20;

1. Receive data from applications.
2. Voluntarily prove facts about their user data.&#x20;
3. Users cannot refuse to receive data from an application.

The high-level goal for **UniRep** is to be a base layer on top of which anyone can easily build _custom_, yet _interoperable_, reputation systems. For instance, users could create combined zero-knowledge proofs of reputation across different social media platforms, consumer apps, or financial applications in order to provide holistic, private, and trustworthy information about themselves to others.
