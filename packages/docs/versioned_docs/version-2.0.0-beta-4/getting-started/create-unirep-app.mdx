# üöÄ Getting Started with `create-unirep-app`

The [create-unirep-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-unirep-app) package provides a convenient and efficient way to build applications that leverage the power of UniRep. Developers can use the following guide to explore the example attester, and then customize the attester to suit their unique application.

## üíª Run the application locally

### Installation

1. Run:

```shell
npx create-unirep-app
```

**OR**

2. Clone the [Unirep/create-unirep-app](https://github.com/unirep/create-unirep-app) repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/unirep/create-unirep-app &&
cd create-unirep-app &&
yarn
```

### Build the files

Navigate to the new directory and run:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Start a blockchain environment with Hardhat

Run:

```shell
yarn contracts hardhat node
```

:::info
See [hardhat tutorial](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start)
:::

### Deploy smart contracts

The `UnirepApp.sol` smart contract is an **[attester](protocol/users-and-attesters.md#attesters-ü§ñ)** and interacts directly with `Unirep.sol`. Both smart contracts will be deployed in the Hardhat environment.<br/> In a new terminal window, from root, run:

```shell
yarn contracts deploy
```

:::info
If `Unirep.sol` has been deployed in the testnet, specify the address of the `Unirep.sol` in the `UnirepApp` constructor:

```solidity
constructor(
   Unirep _unirep,
   ...
)
```

:::
The contract configurations will be written to `create-unirep-app/config.ts`

### Start the relayer (backend)

The example attester hosts a relayer to handle requests from the frontend and post transactions to the blockchain. It also provides proving keys for the frontend prover.<br/>To start the relayer, run:

```shell
yarn relay start
```

Proceed when `Listening on port 8000` is displayed in the terminal.

### Start the frontend server

The frontend is the **[users'](protocol/users-and-attesters.md#users-üë§)** interface to interact with the attester (`UnirepApp.sol`).<br/>In a new terminal window, from root, run:

```shell
yarn frontend start
```

The frontend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` by default.

## üèóÔ∏è `create-unirep-app` Architecture

It is important to note that the architecture of this application is different from that of traditional dApps, which require users to obtain ETH, use a browser wallet, understand gas fees, etc. This presents a steep learning curve for new users and a poor UX.

With `create-unirep-app`, the architecture is Web App <-> Relay <-> Blockchain. This reduces the cognitive load for a user new to blockchain appplications by abstracting that learning curve into the relay:

![Architecture](@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/architecture.png)

While use of the relayer is optional for a Unirep application, developers should be aware that if users send transactions directly to `UnirepApp.sol`, their privacy could be compromised.
:::

## üïπÔ∏è Interacting with the example attester

### User Sign Up

![Join](@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/join.png)

Clicking the **Join** button prompts the client to generate a [Semaphore Identity](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) and a [signup proof](circuits-api/circuits.md#signup-proof).

The relayer will submit the signup proof to `UnirepApp.sol` and the client will store the Semaphore identity secret in the browser. When the transaction completes successfully, the user has been added to the attester's membership and can access the application with the **Dashboard** button.

![Dashboard](@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/dashboard.png)

### Information

**Epoch** <br />
Displays the attester's [epoch](protocol/epoch.md) details and the current user's last transitioned epoch.

**Latest Data**<br/>
Displays the user's total [data](protocol/data.md), including data changed in the current epoch that can not yet be proven.<br/>
This is updated upon each data change request.

**Provable Data**<br/>
Displays only provable data that the user can currently prove ownership of. Any change made to the user's data since their last [user state transition](protocol/user-state-transition.md) is not included here. This is updated **after** UST is performed.

### Request Data

<img
    src={require('@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/request_data.png').default}
    title="Request data"
    width="400"
/>

**Change Data**<br/>
In the example application, the user simply requests the [data](protocol/data.md) they want to receive. (Real attesters will implement their own logic to determine why and how data is attributed to their users.)

There are two types of data fields: _sum fields_ and _replacement fields_. <br />

-   A _sum field_ carries a total of all the data that has been added to it.
-   A _replacement field_ is used to fully replace old data with new data.

Users can choose which of their anonymous identifiers ([epoch keys](protocol/epoch-key.md)) will receieve the attestation by choosing an _epoch key nonce_. A unique identifier is generated for each epoch key nonce in each epoch.

```shell
# epoch key nonce = 0
Requesting data with epoch key:
0x2b4b15e0173f69807318198d5c1db6c00c44380af2e05912608950e10ba04b43
# epoch key nonce = 1
Requesting data with epoch key:
0x15e1358a646a10aa99756a250d9463b6026fbd09c5f4d28e477085f21eecd197
```

The data received by each of a user's epoch keys will be accumulated to that user.

**e.g.** <br/>
`data[0] = 1` is requested by epoch key: `0x2b4b15e0173f69807318198d5c1db6c00c44380af2e05912608950e10ba04b43`<br/>
`data[0] = 2` is requested by epoch key: `0x15e1358a646a10aa99756a250d9463b6026fbd09c5f4d28e477085f21eecd197`

1+2=3 so the final `data[0]` of the user is `3`.

:::caution
These epoch keys last for only one epoch. At the start of each epoch, new epoch keys are generated and old epoch keys become invalid.
:::

**Attest**

Upon clicking the **attest** button, the following steps are executed to process an attestation:

1. Client generates an [epoch key proof](circuits-api/circuits.md#epoch-key-proof) to prove the epoch key is valid
2. Client submits the epoch key proof and the requested data to the relayer
3. Relayer uses `UnirepApp.sol` to call [attest](contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attest) on the `Unirep.sol` contract
4. Frontend updates the user's _latest data_ (data is not yet provable)

### User State Transtion

<img
    src={require('@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/ust.png').default}
    title="User state transition"
    width="300"
/>

A [user state transition](protocol/user-state-transition.md) is performed manually by a user in any any epoch they want to participate in. The user will not be able to receive data if `Current epoch #` does not match `Latest transition epoch` (found under the Epoch section); UST must be completed first. <br/>
Clicking the **Transition** button executes the following steps:

1. Client generates a [user state transition proof](circuits-api/circuits.md#user-state-transition-proof)
2. Client submits the proof to the relayer
3. Relayer updates the `Unirep.sol` contract
4. Frontend updates the user's _provable data_

The latest user status has been recorded on chain; the user can now receive data in the current epoch and their updated provable data can be used to generate a [data proof](#prove-data).

### Prove Data

<img
    src={require('@site/static/img/create-unirep-app/prove_data.png').default}
    title="Prova data"
    width="200"
/>

In the example attester, there is no functionality that requires proof of any data; individual attesters will define the purpose of proofs for their unique application.

The example input fields take the data a user wishes to claim. Clicking the **Generate Proof** button creates a data proof with the claim data and sends it to the prover to be verified. A proof will be valid if the claimed data is greater than or equal to the user's provable data.

**e.g.**<br/>
If user's provable data is:

```shell
Provable Data 0 = 2
Provable Data 1 = 3
Provable Data 2 = 4
Provable Data 3 = 5
```

the user can claim they have data:

```shell
Claim Data 0 = 2
Claim Data 1 = 2
Claim Data 2 = 2
Claim Data 3 = 2
```

because:

```shell
2 (Provable Data 0) >= 2 (Claim Data 0) # satisfied. 2 === 2
3 (Provable Data 1) >= 2 (Claim Data 1) # satisfied. 3 > 2
4 (Provable Data 2) >= 2 (Claim Data 2) # satisfied. 4 > 2
5 (Provable Data 3) >= 2 (Claim Data 3) # satisfied. 5 > 2
```

If the proof is valid, the frontend will display the proof and "Is proof valid? **true**" below the **Generate Proof** button.

If the proof is invalid, the snarkjs prover will throw an error.

**e.g.**<br/>
If user's provable data is:

```shell
Provable Data 0 = 2 üëà
Provable Data 1 = 3
Provable Data 2 = 4
Provable Data 3 = 5
```

and they claim to own the data:

```shell
Claim Data 0 = 3 üëà
Claim Data 1 = 3
Claim Data 2 = 3
Claim Data 3 = 3
```

The prover will throw an error because the fields with emojis do not satisfy the conditions:

```shell
2 (Provable Data 0) >= 3 (Claim Data 0) # not satisfied. 2 is not greater than or equal to 3
```

## üí° Build your own application

Start by modifying the [`UnirepApp.sol`](https://github.com/Unirep/create-unirep-app/blob/2ca9aaa3fcacb9282993b8f5d5917afc482ec089/packages/contracts/contracts/UnirepApp.sol) contract.

### Define epoch length

Each attester sets its own [epoch](protocol/epoch.md) length, determined by the needs of the application. When deciding their attester's epoch length, developers should consider the following trade-offs.<br/>

Longer epoch lengths:

-   allow users more time to receive new data, especially in cases with user-to-user interactions
-   extend the time users must wait for changed data to be provable
-   risk making users pseudonymous, as their activities may be tracked when using the same epoch keys for an long period of time

Shorter epoch lengths:

-   allow users to prove new data sooner
-   limit opportunities for users to receive new data, as their epoch keys expire quickly
-   may enable a higher degree of user anonymity, as user's anonymous identifiers change more frequently

```sol
unit48 epochLength = 60 * 15; // 15 minutes
unirep.attesterSignUp(epochLength);
```

:::info
See [attesterSignUp](contracts-api/unirep-sol.md#attestersignup)
:::

### Customize attestation policy

Attesters define their own systems to format user data and regulate how that data is attributed to users. An application's user data might represent aspects of a user's status, actions, associations, reputation, etc.

The attester may implement its policy with any combination of smart contract code (customizing `UnirepApp.sol`) and traditional application logic. (The application may require a user to satisfy an on-chain OR an off-chain condition in order to receive new data.)

**e.g.**<br/>
An attester wants to limit the amount of data a user can receive in each epoch. The code below utilizes a simple mapping to prevent an attestation to an epoch key if it has already received a value:

```sol
mapping(uint => bool) epochKeyReceivedValue;

function submitAttestation(
   uint epochKey
) public {
   // check if the epoch key has received data
   require(epochKeyReceivedValue[epochKey] == false);
   // compute attester ID: the address of the smart contract
   uint160 attesterId = uint160(address(this));
   // get current epoch from unirep
   uint48 targetEpoch = unirep.attesterCurrentEpoch(attesterId);
   // fix field index
   uint fieldIndex = 0;
   // fix data value
   uint val = 1;
   // call unirep attest function
   unirep.attest(
      epochKey,
      targetEpochs,
      fieldIndex,
      val
   );
   // mark the epoch key has received data
   epochKeyReceivedValue[epochKey] = true;
}
```

**e.g.**<br/>
An attester needs to track the total number of posts a user has made. The code below executes an attestation to increment the user's post count when the user submits a valid post. Note that this must be enforced on the server side:

```js
<input
    type="submit"
    value="POST"
    onClick={async () => {
        // check if user is transitioned to current epoch
        if (
            user.userState &&
            user.userState.sync.calcCurrentEpoch() !==
                (await user.userState.latestTransitionedEpoch())
        ) {
            throw new Error('Needs transition')
        }
        // create new entry in off-chain database
        await app.createNewPost(postData)
        // submit attestation to increment user's post count
        await user.requestReputation({ [0]: 1 }, reqInfo.nonce ?? 0)
    }}
/>
```

### Verify epoch key

An [epoch key proof](circuits-api/circuits.md#epoch-key-proof) is submitted when a request is made to change to user data. Attesters can choose to verify proofs off-chain (with a relay, as in the demo attester) or on-chain.

For example, `UnirepApp.sol` can be modified by adding the epoch key proof:

:::info
See [`EpochKeyVerifierHelper`](contracts-api/verifiers/epoch-key-verifier-helper.md) to learn how to deploy a verifier and its APIs.
:::

1. Import the `EpochKeyVerifierHelper` from [`@unirep/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unirep/contracts).

```sol
import { EpochKeyVerifierHelper } from '@unirep/contracts/verifierHelpers/EpochKeyVerifierHelper.sol';
```

2. Sepcify the address of the deployed verifier.

```sol
// add a public verifier
EpochKeyVerifierHelper public epkVerifier;
constructor(
    // ...
    // pass the verifier address while construction
    EpochKeyVerifierHelper _epkVerifier
){
    // ...
    // set the public verifier to this address
    epkVerifier = _epkVerifier;
}
```

3. Pass the `publicSignals` and `proof` to verify it in the function.

```sol
function submitAttestation(
    uint[] memory publicSignals,
    uint[8] memory proof
) public {
    // verify epoch key proof and check if the caller matches the attester ID in the proof
    epkVerifier.verifyAndCheckCaller(publicSignals, proof);
}
```

But how can we tell which signal is the epoch key?<br/>
`EpochKeyVerifierHelper.sol` provides [`decodeEpochKeySignals`](contracts-api/verifiers/epoch-key-verifier-helper.md#decodeepochkeysignals) to fix this problem.

We can complete the `submitAttestation` function with `decodeEpochKeySignals`.

```sol
mapping(uint => bool) epochKeyReceivedValue;

function submitAttestation(
   uint[] memory publicSignals,
   uint[8] memory proof
) public {
    // verify epoch key proof
    epkVerifier.verifyAndCheckCaller(publicSignals, proof);
    // decode epoch key signals
    EpochKeyVerifierHelper.EpochKeySignals memory signals = epkVerifier
            .decodeEpochKeySignals(publicSignals);
    // check if the epoch key receives data or not
    require(epochKeyReceivedValue[signals.epochKey] == false);
    // compute attester ID: the address of the smart contract
    uint160 attesterId = uint160(address(this));
    // get current epoch from unirep
    uint48 targetEpoch = unirep.attesterCurrentEpoch(attesterId);
    // verify the state tree root in current epoch
    require(
        unirep.attesterStateTreeRootExists(
            attesterId,
            targetEpoch,
            signals.stateTreeRoot
        )
    );
    // fix field index
    uint fieldIndex = 0;
    // fix data value
    uint val = 1;
    // call UniRep attest function
    unirep.attest(
        signals.epochKey,
        targetEpoch,
        fieldIndex,
        val
    );
    // mark the epoch key has received data
    epochKeyReceivedValue[signals.epochKey] = true;
}
```

**Now you can start building your own application with UniRep. üöÄ**
