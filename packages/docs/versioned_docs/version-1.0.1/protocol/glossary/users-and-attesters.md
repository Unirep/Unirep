# Users and Attesters

## Actors in Unirep

### User ðŸ‘¤

There are users who **receive reputation** and **prove received reputation**.

* Users sign up by calling <mark style="color:blue;">`userSignUp`</mark> in Unirep contract
* User's <mark style="color:green;">`identityCommitment`</mark> is revealed at this time and it will be recorded in the contract to prevent double signup.
* The identity commitment will not reveal the actual <mark style="color:red;">`identity`</mark> of the user but at the same time allow user to prove identity in the circuit.

### Attester ðŸ‘‘

There are attesters who **give attestations** to users and the attestations become the users' reputation.

* Attesters sign up by calling <mark style="color:blue;">`attesterSignUp`</mark> in Unirep contract.
* Attesters would be given `attesterId` by the order they sign up, `attesterId` begins with `1`.
* Attester information and attestation history are _public_ and so everyone can see which attester submits which attestation to the Unirep contract.
