# Unirep Social

With UniRep protocol, the Unirep Social can be an anonymous social media but people should be responsible for what they say. If a person spend his reputation to post a spam, then others can downvote the person. Once the person cannot generate a reputation proof with enough reputation nullifiers, he will be silenced for a period of a time according to how much negative reputation he received.&#x20;
