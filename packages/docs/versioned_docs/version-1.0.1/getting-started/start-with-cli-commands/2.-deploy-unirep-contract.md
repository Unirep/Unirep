# 2. Deploy Unirep contract

Deploy the UniRep smart contract with a private key.

```bash
npx ts-node cli/index.ts deploy -d $USER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** `-d` is the deployer's private key.

See: [cli/deploy](../../cli/deploy-unirep-contract.md) for more `deploy` options.
{% endhint %}

Then the Unirep contract address will be printed:

```bash
Unirep: 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F
```

* Then we use the Unirep contract's address to interact with.
* Export contract address to the environment:

```bash
export UNIREP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F
```
