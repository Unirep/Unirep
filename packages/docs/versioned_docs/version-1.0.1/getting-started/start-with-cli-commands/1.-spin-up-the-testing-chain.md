# 1. Spin up the testing chain

In the Unirep repository, go to`./packages/core` and run a hardhat testing node:

```bash
cd packages/core && \
npx hardhat node
```

:::info
**NOTE:** a list of default accounts will be printed, choose one of them to be user's account and one to be attester's. User's and attester's private key will be referred to as `userPrivateKey` and `attesterPrivateKey` respectively.
:::

* For example, choose `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` as the user's private key and `0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d` as the attester's private key

* In new terminal window, go to `packages/core`

```bash
cd packages/core
```
* Export both keys to the environment:

```bash
export USER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
export ATTESTER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
```
