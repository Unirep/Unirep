# 8. Submit epoch key proof to Unirep smart contract

The epoch key proof should be submitted to the Unirep smart contract, and obtain a proof index from Unirep smart contract, then it can be verified by others and be sent attestations.

```bash
npx ts-node cli/index.ts submitEpochKeyProof \
    -x $UNIREP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS  \
    -d $USER_PRIVATE_KEY  \
    -pf $EPOCH_KEY_PROOF  \
    -p $EPOCH_PUBLIC_SIGNALS
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** See [cli/submitEpochKeyProof](../../cli/epoch-key-and-proof.md#submitepochkeyproof) for more `submitEpochKeyProof` options.
{% endhint %}

* The proof index will be printed, for example:

```
Proof index:  1
```

* Then the epoch key with the proof index should be handed to attester to be attested.
